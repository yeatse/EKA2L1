## Archived planning docs

These tracked the initial port to completion and are no longer updated:

- [`IOS_PORTING_PLAN.md`](./IOS_PORTING_PLAN.md) — original iOS port proposal/roadmap.
- [`IOS_PORTING_TASKS.md`](./IOS_PORTING_TASKS.md) — stage-by-stage task tracker with verification results and a changelog; the closest thing to a full project history.
